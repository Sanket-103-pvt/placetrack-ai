  const seedQuestions = [
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "Explain the difference between value types and reference types in programming.", modelAnswer: "Value types store the data directly (like primitive numbers, booleans), whereas reference types store a pointer or reference to the memory location where the actual data resides (like objects, arrays, classes)." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?", modelAnswer: "GET is used to retrieve data from a server and is idempotent, appending parameters in the URL. POST is used to send data to a server to create/update resources, and parameters are sent in the request body, making it safer for sensitive data." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "Explain how React's virtual DOM works to optimize page rendering.", modelAnswer: "React maintains a lightweight virtual representation of the real DOM. When state changes, a new Virtual DOM tree is created. React compares it with the previous tree (diffing), determines the minimum number of changes, and batches updates to the real DOM (reconciliation)." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "What is an index in a database, and how does it speed up queries?", modelAnswer: "An index is a data structure (typically a B-Tree) that stores pointer references to table rows sorted by index keys. It allows the database engine to find matches in logarithmic time (binary search) instead of executing a full table scan." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "Explain the design and operation of a distributed lock service using Redis or Zookeeper.", modelAnswer: "A distributed lock system prevents race conditions across instances. Using Redis, Redlock uses SETNX to set a key with a TTL and unique token on a majority of nodes. Acquisition is successful only if the majority of nodes grant it within the lock lease time." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "How would you design a distributed rate limiter for an API with millions of daily requests?", modelAnswer: "Use a Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket algorithm backed by Redis. Redis' sorted sets can track timestamps of request arrival within a sliding window. Atomicity can be guaranteed using Lua scripting to evaluate and decrement bucket limits." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?", modelAnswer: "INNER JOIN returns rows only when there is a match in both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table, filling with NULL if no match exists." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "Explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative data.", modelAnswer: "Quantitative data is numerical, measurable, and countable (e.g., salary, age, sales volume). Qualitative data is descriptive, categorical, and non-numerical (e.g., feedback text, country names, satisfaction levels)." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "What is overfitting in machine learning, and how can you prevent it?", modelAnswer: "Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise and detail in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts performance on new data. It can be prevented by cross-validation, regularization (L1/L2), pruning decision trees, or gathering more training data." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "What is the Central Limit Theorem, and why is it important?", modelAnswer: "The CLT states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population distribution shape. This allows analysts to perform parametric tests (like t-tests) on non-normal populations." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "Explain how you would handle data leakage in a predictive modeling pipeline.", modelAnswer: "Data leakage happens when information from the target variable/test set leaks into training. Prevent it by splitting the data into train/test before any preprocessing (imputation, scaling, feature engineering), and using pipeline objects (like scikit-learn Pipeline) to enforce separation." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "How do you evaluate model performance when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets?", modelAnswer: "Standard accuracy is misleading. Evaluate using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Precision-Recall AUC, and confusion matrices. You can also apply SMOTE (oversampling), undersampling, or adjust the class weights in the loss function." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "What is Ohm's Law and how is it applied in basic circuits?", modelAnswer: "Ohm's Law states that current (I) is directly proportional to voltage (V) and inversely proportional to resistance (R), written as V = I * R. It is used to size resistors and calculate voltage drops in electrical circuits." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Technical", question: "What is the difference between stress and strain in mechanics?", modelAnswer: "Stress is the internal resistance force per unit area acting within a deformed body. Strain is the measure of deformation or elongation per unit length resulting from that applied stress." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "Explain the difference between a four-stroke and a two-stroke internal combustion engine.", modelAnswer: "A four-stroke engine completes one power cycle in four strokes of the piston (intake, compression, power, exhaust) requiring two crankshaft rotations. A two-stroke engine completes a power cycle in two strokes and one crankshaft rotation, offering higher power density but lower fuel efficiency." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Technical", question: "What is Bernoulli's Principle, and how does it explain airplane lift?", modelAnswer: "Bernoulli's Principle states that an increase in fluid velocity occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure. Air flows faster over the curved top of an airfoil than the flat bottom, creating lower pressure on top and higher pressure beneath, resulting in upward lift." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "Describe the thermodynamic cycles of a gas turbine vs. a steam power plant.", modelAnswer: "Gas turbines operate on the Brayton cycle (open cycle, compression, constant pressure combustion, expansion). Steam power plants operate on the Rankine cycle (closed cycle, constant pressure boiling, isentropic expansion, condensation, pumping), utilizing phase changes for higher thermal efficiency." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Technical", question: "Explain the Nyquist Stability Criterion in control systems engineering.", modelAnswer: "The Nyquist Criterion determines the stability of a closed-loop system by evaluating the frequency response of its open-loop transfer function. The closed-loop system is stable if the Nyquist plot of the open-loop system does not encircle the point (-1, j0) in the complex plane under specific conditions." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Behavioral", question: "Why do you want to join our company?", modelAnswer: "The candidate should align their personal values and career aspirations with the company's mission, products, and culture, giving specific examples of their recent achievements and how they plan to contribute." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "EASY", category: "Behavioral", question: "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly. How did you approach it?", modelAnswer: "Describe using the STAR method: Situation (project), Task (new tool), Action (structured tutorials, building small POCs, reading docs), and Result (successful delivery and key learnings)." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Behavioral", question: "Describe a time you had a technical disagreement with a team member. How was it resolved?", modelAnswer: "Show communication and compromise. Emphasize listing pros and cons objectively, gathering data or building a quick prototype to compare options, and aligning behind the best solution for the project." },
    { role: "Core Engineering", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "Behavioral", question: "Describe a project setback you experienced and how you handled it.", modelAnswer: "Focus on resilience and problem-solving. Outline the setback, the immediate mitigation steps, the root-cause analysis, and how the project was successfully steered back on track." },
    { role: "SDE", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Behavioral", question: "Tell me about a time you took a calculated risk that failed. What did you learn?", modelAnswer: "Demonstrate ownership and analytical review. Detail the risk assessment, what went wrong, how you handled the fallout, and the systemic changes implemented to prevent it in the future." },
    { role: "Data Analyst", difficulty: "HARD", category: "Behavioral", question: "How do you manage deadlines and prioritize tasks when multiple critical projects collide?", modelAnswer: "Detail prioritization frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix, communication with stakeholders to align expectations, delegate when possible, and track progress using agile tools." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "EASY", category: "HR", question: "Tell me about yourself.", modelAnswer: "A concise professional pitch covering your educational background, placement readiness focus, core skills, recent projects, and career enthusiasm in 2-3 minutes." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "EASY", category: "HR", question: "What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?", modelAnswer: "List strengths backed by examples (e.g., problem-solving, collaboration). State a genuine weakness that you are actively working to improve (e.g., public speaking, over-committing) and show current progress." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "HR", question: "Where do you see yourself in five years?", modelAnswer: "Demonstrate commitment to professional growth within the domain, aiming to lead technical initiatives, master advanced architectures, and mentor junior developers." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "MEDIUM", category: "HR", question: "How do you handle working under tight pressure?", modelAnswer: "Explain stress management techniques like breaking tasks down, keeping open channels of communication with stakeholders, and focusing on incremental delivery." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "HARD", category: "HR", question: "How would you handle a situation where you realized a major release had a critical bug right before deployment?", modelAnswer: "Prioritize transparency and quick mitigation. Notify the team immediately, roll back or postpone the release if necessary, deploy a hotfix, and perform a post-mortem to prevent recurrence." },
    { role: "HR", difficulty: "HARD", category: "HR", question: "What is your stance on working overtime or adjusting to sudden change in requirements?", modelAnswer: "Show flexibility and commitment to project success while emphasizing the importance of sustainable pacing, proactive planning, and clear communication within the team." }
